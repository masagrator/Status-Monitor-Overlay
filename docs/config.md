# Configuration file

Configuration file is in `sdmc:/config/status-monitor/`. By default it's named `config.ini.template`. To be detected by overlay it must be renamed to `config.ini`.

---

Explanation of what each setting does.<br>
Colors are provided in RGBA4444 format, which means that each character represents different channel: red, green, blue, alpha.

| Key | Explanation | Possible values | Default Value |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| `key_combo` | Buttons combination that allows exiting Full, Mini, Micro, FPS Graph and FPS Counter modes; max 4 buttons, otherwise next buttons will be ignored. Combine different buttons with `+` | `A`, `B`, `X`, `Y`, `L`, `R`, `ZL`, `ZR`, `PLUS`, `MINUS`, `DUP`, `DDOWN`, `DLEFT`, `DRIGHT`, `SL`, `SR`, `LSTICK`, `RSTICK`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` | `L+DDOWN+RSTICK` |
| `battery_avg_iir_filter` | Read voltage + current averages directly from fuel gauge, that uses infinite impulse response filter | `true`, `false` | `false` |
| `battery_time_left_refreshrate` | How many seconds must pass to refresh Battery Remaining Time | from `1` to `60` | `60` |
| `average_gpu_load` | Average 5 last GPU load readings. Because GPU load by design shows only load for last 1/60s, this option allows for more accurate gpu load readings at the cost of slight bump in CPU Core #3 usage (from 2 to 4 percentage points depending on CPU clock). | `true`, `false` | `false` |
