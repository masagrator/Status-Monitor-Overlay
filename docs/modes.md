# Micro

Contains most of supported informations with lower precision in one line.

It shows only if you didn't change filename of overlay file (So it should be "Status-Monitor-Overlay.ovl").
This is because we need to reload overlay to change framebuffer dimensions without taking more RAM,
and Tesla Menu (and libtesla with it) doesn't provide info about filename of overlay that was loaded.

Works only in 1 or 5 Hz + vsync signal. You can change that with ZR + R + D-Pad Up/Down

# FPS Counter

It shows only FPS value in 31Hz + vsync signal. <br>
If game is not launched, it will show always 254.0 value.<br>
You can move counter to the bottom or top of the screen by pressing ZR + R + D-Pad Up/Down.

Mode available only with SaltyNX installed.

# Graphs

> FPS

It shows avergae FPS graph in 31Hz + vsync signal. In background of graph you can see rendered actual average FPS.<br>
If game is not launched, it will show always 254.0 value and graph will be empty.<br>
If game is not rendering any new frame, graph is not updated.

If line is within rounding error of graph line, it's colored. Average FPS must be between -0.05 and +0.04 of graph line target FPS. So for 30 FPS it's between 29.95 - 30.04 FPS. For 43 FPS it's 42.95 - 43.04 FPS.
If it's in 30 or 60 FPS rounding error range, it's green. Any other FPS graph target is purple.

You can move counter to the bottom or top of the screen by pressing ZR + R + D-Pad Up/Down.

Mode available only with SaltyNX installed.

# Additional info

> What is Skin temperature (tskin)?

This is temperature calculated from SoC and PCB temperatures that is mainly used to prevent Switch from overheating. Reading it is not supported on FWs <5.0.0.
